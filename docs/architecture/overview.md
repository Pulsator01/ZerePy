# ZerePy Architecture Overview

ZerePy is a modular AI agent framework designed for extensibility, reliability, and maintainability. The framework is built around several core concepts:

## Core Concepts

### Plugin System
- Dynamic plugin discovery and loading
- Standardized plugin interfaces
- Support for both built-in and user plugins
- Plugin lifecycle management

### Event System
- Centralized event bus
- Asynchronous event handling
- Event lifecycle tracking
- Error isolation and recovery

### Resource Management
- Connection pooling
- Resource lifecycle tracking
- Automatic cleanup
- Resource state monitoring

### Configuration Management
- Multiple configuration providers
- Schema-based validation
- Environment and file-based storage
- Hierarchical configuration

## System Components

### Connection Manager
- Manages network connections
- Handles connection lifecycle
- Provides connection pooling
- Ensures proper cleanup

### Action Handler
- Executes agent actions
- Provides retry mechanism
- Validates action parameters
- Tracks action execution

### Event Bus
- Routes events between components
- Provides publish/subscribe mechanism
- Handles event delivery
- Manages error boundaries

### Resource Manager
- Tracks system resources
- Manages resource pools
- Monitors resource usage
- Ensures cleanup

## Design Principles

1. **Modularity**
   - Components are loosely coupled
   - Functionality is encapsulated
   - Dependencies are explicit
   - Interfaces are well-defined

2. **Reliability**
   - Error handling at all levels
   - Resource cleanup guarantees
   - State tracking and recovery
   - Retry mechanisms

3. **Extensibility**
   - Plugin-based architecture
   - Standard interfaces
   - Event-driven communication
   - Configuration flexibility

4. **Maintainability**
   - Clear component boundaries
   - Comprehensive testing
   - Consistent error handling
   - Detailed logging

## System Flow

1. **Initialization**
   - Load configuration
   - Initialize event bus
   - Start resource manager
   - Load plugins

2. **Operation**
   - Handle incoming events
   - Manage resources
   - Execute actions
   - Monitor system state

3. **Cleanup**
   - Release resources
   - Stop event handlers
   - Clean up connections
   - Save state

## Extension Points

1. **Plugins**
   - Custom connections
   - New actions
   - Event handlers
   - Resource types

2. **Configuration**
   - Custom providers
   - Validation schemas
   - Environment setup
   - User settings

3. **Events**
   - Custom event types
   - Event handlers
   - Error handlers
   - Monitoring hooks

4. **Resources**
   - Resource types
   - Pool configurations
   - Cleanup handlers
   - State tracking

## Best Practices

1. **Error Handling**
   - Use proper error types
   - Implement retry logic
   - Clean up resources
   - Log errors appropriately

2. **Resource Management**
   - Use resource pools
   - Implement cleanup
   - Track resource state
   - Monitor usage

3. **Event Handling**
   - Use event boundaries
   - Handle errors properly
   - Validate event data
   - Monitor performance

4. **Configuration**
   - Validate configs
   - Use proper scopes
   - Handle missing values
   - Document options
